This is some code of 2 past projects done at EPFL.
One with Matlab and a second one with python.

The one with Matlab is from the "Machine learning programming" course where you can find 5 assigments, each one on a different machine learning subject. I removed all the data to avoid having big folders on this repository.

The second one is a project from the course "Basic of mobile robotics" given by prof. Mondada. The goal was to implement optimal path planning for a Thymio robot on an hand made 2 meters squared map.

You can find more informations in the README of each project folder.
