    "But for this project, we focused only on a part of the map like you can see in the figure2. Thymio will evolve on this map where there is two houses and four parking spots. Three of this spots are occupied and only one of them is free. There will be some \"dumb\" Thymio that will evolve in this map too, our Thymio have to avoid them, using Local Navigation. \n",

    "### 1.1 Computer vision and Kalman filter\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera allows us to implement the computer vision module. We use it to manage the Global Navigation. With the analysis of the video from the camera, we will extract the obstacles’ center position and their size, the parking slots, in addition to the position of the robot all along the road to its goal. The camera will give us the image with an RGB array where we will have all the pixels of the map. \n",
    "To implement the image processing, we essentially use the library  “ OpenCV”. This library includes very useful functions to extract data from a picture. As for the detection of the colors in the image, the work of the Youtube channel L42Project (the GitHub repository is https://github.com/L42Project/Tutoriels/tree/master/Divers/tutoriel36) was very helpful. We have also based our Kalman filter on this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main part of the vision was to detect the position of the robot at each iteration. This means the x and y robot positions as well as its orientation. In order to do this, we have put on the robot two purple/pink points to get a vector of the position. Therefore, the angle orientation is computed by finding the angle between the vector position and the x-axis. \n",
    "The detection of these points is based on the fact that the biggest purple/pink point on the map will be the bottom point of the robot, and the second biggest one is the top point of the robot. \n",
    "For this, we select all the purple/pink points larger than a certain area and we sort the points to find the two biggest. This is done with the help of the sort() methods from OpenCV.\n",
    "The mask for the blue and green shape is made with the methods from OpenCV findContour().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman as mentioned above is based on the Kalman Filter from the L42Project. However, we made several changes to adapt the code to our project. \n",
    "We have modified the matrix by giving the measure of the speed in the Observation matrix and to improve the prediction. There were some difficulties to find the good size of the matrix and the right values. But the main challenge was to have a Kalman filter which provides us coherent values when the camera has some quick moments of absence. To solve this problem, we use two different Kalman filters (one for each point on the robot) to be able to compute the orientation in case the camera cannot give it to us. Indeed, we need for our system the position and the orientation of the robot to set the speed of the wheels. And by knowing the position of the two points on the robot, we can identify a vector position and hence the angle with the x axis."

    "\n",
    "Type of path calculation : We choose to implement the A* algorithm that we have see during the course and the exercices.\n",
    "In order to do that, we had to transform the frame that the camera give us to a grid of desired lenght.\n",

    "We choose the square by side to have a good precision but a low cost of calculation. Therefore we have to deal between thoses too parameters. After some testing we choose avalue of 50 squares for the smallest side. That give us  \n",
    "Those are the steps that we applied on the frame to obtain a final squared wanted grid with the obstacles in it : \n",
    "- Take the frame\n",
    "<img src=\"image/frame.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",

    "<img src=\"image/secured.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 100px;\"/>\n",
    "- Resize the expand mask grid to have a wanted squared dimention and no more pixels dimention. This is the final grid.\n",

    "We run this \"initialisation\" one time before the \"runing\" loop to avoid useless recomputation of the path each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the optimal path has been compute, we defined the current goal as the next path point until we are on the final goal. We then have implemented a fonction to update the current goal to send to the control and movement part (see 1.3). \n",
    "Now the robot just have to follow the updated current goals.\n"

    "The function takes continuously as parameters the position of the robot and its angle which are given by the Vision module. The angle is in the range of [-pi, pi]. It also takes as parameters the continuously updated goals that are given by the Optimal Path module.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement a function that computes the error in position (which is the distance between the goal and the robot) and the error in angle (We are inspired by the function described in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2827393/angles-between-two-n-dimensional-vectors-in-python to determine the angle of the goal. We changed it to be optimal to the variation we want from the robot (all explained in the comments)).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the angle is computed as a difference between the goal and the robot, if it's positif, then the robot should turn to the left, and if it's negatif, it should turn to the right, which is why we substract the angular error from the right motor speed, and add it to the left motor speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a more general way, the function \"move_to_position\" implements a PD (Proportionnal Derivative Controller), by adding a certain speed computed via the remaining distance (multiplied by an experimental coefficient) and adding/substracting an angular speed (multiplied by another experimental coefficient) to the motor's speed. These are added to some basic speed, because otherwise the speed of the robot will be almost zero when it reaches the updated goals. \n",

    "### 1.4 Local navigation and \"Dumb\" robot implementation\n",
    "We use the local navigation in order to avoid the other cars of the \"city\". Those other cars are the \"dumb\" Thymio in this project. Our principle is the following:\n",
    "<img src=\"image/MAIN_LN.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to make our Thymio go a little bit wider in order to let the \"Dumb\" Thymio leaves without any collision. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We disable this avoid functionality when we are soon arrived to the parking place** in order to make the parking maneuvers easier for Thymio. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the avoid function was inspired by the exercices of the course from the week 4. It means that we used the principle that when the robot \"sees\" an object in front of it, we accelerate the weels near this obstacle. We don't use the external horizontal sensors because we would like to be able to follow walls. However, we use them to compute the value of the speed when there's an object detected. It allow us to be more precise (regarding our tests). As we don't want to see the walls to early (otherwise we could not follow the optimal path without interupting it all the time) we avoid obstacles at a very short distance. To be able to do that, we turn on the same spot and not \"smoothly\" like in the exercices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we saved in a global variable if the robot saw an object to the right or to the left. The main reason is to help Thymio to turn back if it is bloqued. The other reason is that it makes our turns more clean when there's an object in one side if we turn on the same spot even is the left obstacle is far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also computed differently our speed if there was an obstacle only in front of Thymio (otherwise it would turn very large and would often crash into the object). We kept the principle to compute the speed regarding the sensors values in order to give a smoother change of speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to check if there's no more obstacles in Thymio's way, we are checking the front and the two interior side sensors but not the external side ones in case we would be along a wall. \n",
    "\n",
    "About the \"dumb\" robot implementation, it is developped in a different section below as we thought it was more logical that way. "
