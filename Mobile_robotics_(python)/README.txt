This is some python code from the "Mobile robotic" course project at EPFL.
The goal was to implement vision, optimal path planning and locomotion with a small Thymio robot with prof. Mondada.  
This project was done by group of 4. Therefore all the code in this folder do not come from me.

File that I code:

- Local_navigation.py
- optimal_path.py
- Map.py
- A good part of "main.ipynb"
